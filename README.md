# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game

I developed an engaging rock-paper-scissors game application using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, featuring an interactive user interface (UI). In this game, players compete against the computer, with scores calculated dynamically. To enhance the user experience, I implemented local storage techniques to store both the current scores and the highest score achieved in the game.
